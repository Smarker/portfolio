# Stephanie Marker's portfolio

I am still working on my developer portfolio, but you can take a look at what I have done so far [here](http://www.stephaniemarker.com).

## Known Issues

* Refresh of a page results in 404 - high priority
* images make page load slowly - medium priority

## Next Enhancements

* add react meta tags
* add unit tests 
* accessibility http://wave.webaim.org/
* add animation to landing page
* add svgs in vector like the ones on http://devport.co/ front page to first blog post to break up the text
* add volunteering page?
* tag posts so they can be more easily searched
* add ability to search for posts
* paginate the posts
* use react semantic mobile, computer, tablet props (ie only={computer}) instead of just semantic
* Add dimmer on blog post photo?
* Add post about chattybot and remove most details not needed from its readme
* Add https
* Add video of completed smart mirror
* Add video of setting up chatbot

## Way into the Future Enhancements

* Add total number of blog posts
* search blog posts by tag
* Could add a timeline view - not sure if I want to include this 

## Think About
* Maybe I should make the images taller on the see more page for posts
