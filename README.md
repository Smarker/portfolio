# Stephanie Marker's portfolio

I am still working on my developer portfolio, but you can take a look at what I have done so far [here](http://www.stephaniemarker.com).

This app is best viewed in firefox. I will try to update this for other browsers as soon as I can.

## Known Issues

* Refresh of a page results in 404
* images make page load slowly
* CSS transitions on nav do not display on browsers other than firefox.

## Next Enhancements

* add google page speed test to first post, and accessibility http://wave.webaim.org/
* add animation to landing page
* add svgs in vector like the ones on http://devport.co/ front page to first blog post to break up the text
* add volunteering page?
* tag posts so they can be more easily searched
* add ability to search for posts
* paginate the posts
* Make nav blue on mostly white pages
* use react semantic mobile, computer, tablet props (ie only={computer}) instead of just semantic
* Add dimmer on blog post photo?
* Add post about chattybot and remove most details not needed from its readme
* Clean up webpack files
* Add https
* Add video of completed smart mirror
* Add video of setting up chatbot

## Way into the Future Enhancements
