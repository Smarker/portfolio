# Stephanie Marker's portfolio

I am still working on my developer portfolio, but you can take a look at what I have done so far [here](http://www.stephaniemarker.com).

This app is best viewed in firefox. I will try to oupdate this for other browsers as soon as I can.

* CSS transitions on nav do not display on browsers other than firefox.

## Next Enhancements

* Make blog post preview route to entire post
