let SettingUpAPortfolio = `When creating a developer portfolio, it is good to first
plan the structure of your site and determine the technologies needed to make it happen.

## Planning the Structure of Your Portfolio

I wanted to have a mobile-friendly site that would showcase my projects and skills,
while also providing enough space for a tech blog. I found that looking at a lot of examples of others'
developer portfolios helped me figure out how I wanted to lay out my site. I made sure to keep alert for
elements I wanted to include on my site, even if it was just as I normally browsed websites.

### My Portfolio's Structure:
* Home + Tech Blog
* About
* Projects

## Determining What Technologies to Use

To determine the technologies needed, I considered the functionality I needed for the site. I chose Heroku
for web hosting, because it was free and easy to use. I picked namecheap for my domain name, since it had
cheaper domain names than GoDaddy. React would enable me to create my site quickly and easily. I liked it
that React makes you split pieces of functionality into re-usable components. Semantic UI for React enabled
me to create a site friendly for computers, tablets, and mobile devices. I wanted the site to be able to contain
a collection of blog posts with user comments. Down the line, I would need to store user comments in a database.

### How I Set Up My Site:

#### Front End

* Semantic UI React
* React

#### Back End
* Node
* Express
* MongoDB

#### Web Hosting
* Heroku

#### Domain
* Namecheap

## Improving the Usability and Appearance of Your Dev Portfolio
You can make sure that your site is mobile friendly by checking it with Google's
[mobile friendly test](https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly).

## Keeping Track of Site Visitors
You can keep track of the number of visitors to your site, visitor demographics, number of active users,
etc. with [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/).

## Improving the Page Rank Your Portfolio
As I was setting up my site's pages and content, I realized that my portfolio did not show up in searches.
I wanted to make my site known, so I improved the searchability of my site by doing the following:
